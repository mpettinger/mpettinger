Hi I'm Mike Pettinger, and I am new to software development. I'm interested in robotics and AI. I have done a few simple arduino projects, and some work the parallax BS2.

I'm currently learning about the Jetson nano 2GB, and AI.

I would like to collaborate on working with the Jetson nano. I have had many struggles so far as getting it setup and running tutorials.

The best way to reach me is at mikepettinger.cfi@gmail.com
